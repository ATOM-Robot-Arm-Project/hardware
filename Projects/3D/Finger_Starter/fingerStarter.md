# Finger Starter

"This is going to be interesting!!
We are going to assemble a finger to a small servo for testing it with an Arduino board. The servo I used on the pictures is a digital HK15298 but you can use also a cheap analog MG995 or even cheaper if you find and if the size specifications are the same.
The Arduino board used here is a Arduino Uno. It is best to add an external power supply because even if these servos are small they draw too much current which will or might reboot your board.
At the end of this tuto, there is also a picture that illustrate how to simply connect your servo to the board.
REMEMBER: this connection set up can only power a single servo with low Amps drawing, if your board resets itself, or if the servo jitters, it means your servo is to high power consumption for the power pin. You will need an external power supply."


## Parts Needed
- 1 x Servo (HK15298, MG995, or similar)
