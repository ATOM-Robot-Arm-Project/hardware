# What is CAD?

Welcome to the world of Computer-Aided Design (CAD)! If you're new to this, don't worry. This guide will give you a basic understanding of what CAD is and why it's essential for our Robotic Arm project.

## The Basics

At its core, **CAD is the use of computers to create, modify, analyze, or optimize a design.** Instead of drawing blueprints by hand on a drafting table, we use specialized software to create digital 2D drawings and 3D models.

Think of it like digital sculpting or building with virtual LEGOs, but with incredible precision and power.

## Why Do We Use CAD?

Using CAD offers several key advantages for a hardware project like ours:

1.  **Precision:** We can design parts with exact measurements, ensuring everything fits together perfectly.
2.  **Visualization:** A 3D model allows us to see what the robotic arm will look like from every angle before we build anything. We can even simulate its movement to check for collisions or other issues.
3.  **Easy Modifications:** If a part doesn't work as expected, we can quickly modify the digital model and 3D print a new version. This is much faster and cheaper than re-making a physical part from scratch.
4.  **Collaboration:** Team members can easily share designs and work on different parts of the arm simultaneously.
5.  **Manufacturing:** The digital models we create can be directly sent to manufacturing machines, like 3D printers or CNC mills, to create the physical parts.

## Our CAD Software: Fusion 360

For this project, we use **Autodesk Fusion 360**. It's a powerful, cloud-based tool that combines industrial and mechanical design, simulation, collaboration, and machining into a single package. It's a great choice for projects that involve both electronic and mechanical components.

## What's in this Folder?

This `CAD` directory is where we store all the digital blueprints for the robotic arm. As you explore, you'll find different types of files, primarily:

*   **`.f3d` / `.f3z`**: These are the native project files for Fusion 360, containing the editable 3D models and assemblies.
*   **`.stl`**: These are "mesh" files exported from the models, specifically for 3D printing.
*   **`.pdf` / `.dxf`**: These are 2D drawings, useful for manufacturing or documentation.

Feel free to explore the subdirectories to see how the different components of the arm are organized!
