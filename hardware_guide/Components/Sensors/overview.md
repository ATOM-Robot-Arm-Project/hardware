# Sensors Overview

This document provides an overview of the sensors used in the robotic arm project.

## Sensor Types

The robotic arm utilizes various sensors to perceive its environment and internal state. These sensors can be broadly categorized into:

*   **Position Sensors:** These sensors provide information about the angular position of the joints. Common types include encoders and potentiometers. Encoders provide digital feedback, while potentiometers provide analog feedback.
*   **Force/Torque Sensors:** These sensors measure the forces and torques exerted by the arm. This information is crucial for tasks that require delicate manipulation or interaction with the environment. Strain gauges are a common type of force/torque sensor.
*   **Proximity Sensors:** These sensors detect the presence of objects near the gripper without physical contact. Common types include infrared (IR) sensors and ultrasonic sensors.
*   **Other Common Sensors:**
    *   **Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs):** These sensors combine accelerometers and gyroscopes to measure the orientation and angular velocity of the arm.
    *   **Cameras:** Cameras provide visual feedback, enabling the robotic arm to perform tasks like object recognition and tracking.
