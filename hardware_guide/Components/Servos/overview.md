# Servos

Servos are essential components in robotics, providing precise control over angular or linear position. They are fundamental for creating articulated and responsive robotic systems.

## Key Features

- **Positional Control:** Unlike continuous rotation motors, servos can be commanded to move to a specific angle and hold that position.
- **High Torque:** Servos can provide significant torque for their size, making them suitable for lifting and moving objects.
- **Integrated System:** A servo is a self-contained unit that includes a motor, a feedback sensor (like a potentiometer), and control electronics.
- **Simple Interface:** They are typically controlled using a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal, which is easy to generate with most microcontrollers.

## How They Work

A servo motor operates on a closed-loop control system. The control circuit receives a PWM signal that represents the desired position. This signal is compared to the current position of the motor, which is read by the feedback sensor. If there is a difference, the control circuit powers the motor to move it to the correct position.

## Common Applications

- **Robotic Arms:** Each joint in a robotic arm is often controlled by a servo, allowing for precise and repeatable movements.
- **Grippers:** Servos are used to open and close grippers, enabling a robot to interact with objects.
- **Steering Systems:** In mobile robots, servos are used for steering.
- **Camera Platforms:** Servos can be used to create pan-and-tilt platforms for cameras and sensors.
