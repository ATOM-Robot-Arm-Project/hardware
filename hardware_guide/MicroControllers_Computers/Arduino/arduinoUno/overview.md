## Power

The Arduino Uno can be powered via the USB connection or with an external power supply. The power source is selected automatically.

External (non-USB) power can come either from an AC-to-DC adapter (wall-wart) or a battery. The adapter can be connected by plugging a 2.1mm center-positive plug into the board's power jack. Leads from a battery can be inserted in the Gnd and Vin pin headers of the POWER connector.

## Communication

The Arduino Uno has a number of facilities for communicating with a computer, another Arduino, or other microcontrollers.

- **Serial:** The ATmega328P provides UART TTL (5V) serial communication, which is available on digital pins 0 (RX) and 1 (TX).
- **I2C:** The board has a dedicated I2C bus, which is available on pins A4 (SDA) and A5 (SCL).
- **SPI:** The board has a dedicated SPI bus, which is available on pins 10 (SS), 11 (MOSI), 12 (MISO), and 13 (SCK).
