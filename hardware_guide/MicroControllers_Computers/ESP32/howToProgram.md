# How to Program an ESP32

Programming the ESP32 is similar to programming an Arduino. You can use the Arduino IDE with an extension, or you can use other development environments like PlatformIO or the official Espressif IDF (IoT Development Framework).

## Using the Arduino IDE

This is the most common method for beginners.

### 1. Install the Arduino IDE

If you haven't already, download and install the Arduino IDE from the [official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

### 2. Add ESP32 Board Support to Arduino IDE

- Open the Arduino IDE.
- Go to `File > Preferences`.
- In the "Additional Board Manager URLs" field, enter the following URL:
  ```
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
  ```
- Click "OK".
- Go to `Tools > Board > Boards Manager...`.
- Search for "esp32" and install the "esp32 by Espressif Systems" package.

### 3. Configure the IDE for Your ESP32 Board

- Connect your ESP32 board to your computer with a USB cable.
- Go to `Tools > Board` and select your specific ESP32 board (e.g., "ESP32 Dev Module").
- Go to `Tools > Port` and select the correct serial port.

### 4. Write and Upload a Sketch

Now you can write code just like you would for an Arduino. Here's a "Hello, World!" example for the ESP32, which prints to the Serial Monitor.

```cpp
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
}

void loop() {
  Serial.println("Hello from ESP32!");
  delay(1000);
}
```

- Click the "Upload" button to flash the code onto your ESP32.
- Open the Serial Monitor (`Tools > Serial Monitor`) and set the baud rate to 115200 to see the output.

## Using PlatformIO

PlatformIO is a more advanced, cross-platform build system that integrates with code editors like VS Code. It offers better library management and is preferred for larger projects.

- **Installation:** Install Visual Studio Code and then install the PlatformIO IDE extension from the marketplace.
- **Project Setup:** Create a new PlatformIO project and select your ESP32 board.
- **Programming:** Write your code in the `src/main.cpp` file and use the PlatformIO interface to build and upload.
