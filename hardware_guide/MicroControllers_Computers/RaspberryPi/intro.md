# Introduction to Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi is a low-cost, credit-card-sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python.

## What is a Raspberry Pi?

Unlike a microcontroller like an Arduino or ESP32, a Raspberry Pi is a full-fledged single-board computer (SBC). This means it runs a complete operating system (typically a version of Linux called Raspberry Pi OS) and can do most things a desktop computer can do, like browsing the internet, playing videos, and running software.

## Why Use a Raspberry Pi?

- **Versatility:** It can be used as a desktop computer, a web server, a home automation hub, a retro gaming console, a robot brain, and much more.
- **Linux Operating System:** Running a full OS gives you immense power and flexibility. You can install a vast range of open-source software and tools.
- **Processing Power:** Modern Raspberry Pi models have multi-core processors and significant RAM, making them suitable for more computationally intensive tasks than microcontrollers.
- **Connectivity:** They come with USB ports, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and HDMI, making it easy to connect peripherals.
- **GPIO Pins:** Like microcontrollers, the Raspberry Pi has a row of General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins that allow it to control electronic components like LEDs, motors, and sensors.

## Common Raspberry Pi Models

- **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B:** A powerful and popular model with different RAM options (2GB, 4GB, 8GB), dual-monitor support, and USB 3.0 ports.
- **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W:** A tiny, low-cost Pi with wireless connectivity, ideal for small, embedded projects.
- **Raspberry Pi Pico:** This is an exception! The Pico is a **microcontroller**, not a single-board computer. It's designed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to compete with Arduino and is programmed in C/C++ or MicroPython.

## Raspberry Pi vs. Arduino/ESP32

- **Choose a Raspberry Pi when:** You need a full operating system, networking, significant processing power, or want to run complex applications (e.g., a web server, machine learning inference, a media center).
- **Choose an Arduino/ESP32 when:** You need to perform simple, repetitive tasks with low power consumption, read sensors, and control motors in a very reliable and real-time manner.
